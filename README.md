# Time Series Forecast of Number of people killed per day due to Gun Violence

Gun violence should be considered a public health issue, not a political one â€” an epidemic that needs to be addressed with research and evidence-based strategies that can reduce morbidity and mortality. This type of violence includes homicide, violent crime, attempted suicide, suicide, and unintentional death and injury. Firearm violence affects people of all ages and races. Gun violence is a national public health epidemic that exacts a substantial toll on U.S. society. Numerous families must deal with the fallout from this tragedy in addition to the thousands who were killed or hurt. Although figures vary, it is generally accepted that the yearly cost of gun violence to the U.S. economy in terms of medical costs, lost income, daily care/support, and criminal justice costs is around $229 billion.
